# Cassandra SOC Lab

## About Me

My name is **Kack Bayiha Cassandra**.
I am focused on SOC operations, Blue Team defense, incident detection, and security incident reporting.

This repository showcases hands-on security projects built in a realistic lab environment to develop practical skills in monitoring, detection, and structured incident analysis.

My objective is to grow into a **SOC Analyst / Blue Team** role with strong foundations in:

* SIEM monitoring
* Log analysis (Windows, network, authentication, services)
* Incident investigation methodology
* MITRE ATT&CK mapping
* Professional incident reporting

---

## Objective of This Portfolio

This lab demonstrates:

* Practical experience with SIEM platforms
* Detection of real-world attack scenarios
* Log analysis across Windows and network services
* End-to-end SOC L1 workflow (Detect → Analyze → Report → Lessons Learned)
* Mapping detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Each project represents a complete SOC scenario from attack simulation to documented incident report.
